Here, the individual support and promotion of the participants as well as direct contact and dialogue with companies is decisive. In order to convey a transparent impression of the digital working world, the focus is on various unusual excursions to regional IT companies, among other things. This is intended to increase the personal commitment and performance aspirations of the participants. The practical and theoretical mediation units are realised by various teachers and lecturers from regional IT companies. If necessary, they receive support from an interpreter (Arabic and Farsi) to break down language barriers. Our analysis of the participants works out their potential so that an individual self-marketing and application strategy can be designed based on their personality profile.")
